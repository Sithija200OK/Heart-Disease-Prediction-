# Heart-Disease-Prediction-
Overview

This dataset, originally compiled in 1988, is a valuable resource for heart disease prediction. It aggregates data from four sources: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. While the dataset includes 76 attributes, most studies focus on a subset of 14 key attributes. The target attribute indicates the presence of heart disease, represented as:

0: No disease

1: Disease present

Dataset Details

Attribute Information

The following 14 attributes are commonly used in predictive modeling:

Age: Age of the patient in years.

Sex: Gender of the patient (1 = male; 0 = female).

Chest Pain Type:

0: Typical angina

1: Atypical angina

2: Non-anginal pain

3: Asymptomatic

Resting Blood Pressure: Resting blood pressure in mm Hg.

Serum Cholesterol: Cholesterol level in mg/dl.

Fasting Blood Sugar: Whether fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false).

Resting Electrocardiographic Results:

0: Normal

1: ST-T wave abnormality

2: Left ventricular hypertrophy

Maximum Heart Rate Achieved: Maximum heart rate during exercise.

Exercise Induced Angina: (1 = yes; 0 = no).

Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.

Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment:

0: Upsloping

1: Flat

2: Downsloping

Number of Major Vessels: (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.

Thalassemia:

0: Normal

1: Fixed defect

2: Reversible defect

Target: Heart disease indicator (0 = no disease, 1 = disease).

Data Anonymization

To protect patient privacy, names and social security numbers have been replaced with dummy values.

Usage

This dataset can be used for:

Classification tasks to predict the presence of heart disease.

Exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between attributes and heart disease.

Model training and evaluation in machine learning experiments.
